# PUC - The Pull-Up-Counter

Keep track of your pull ups and gain some power ðŸ’ª

## Idea

The idea is to keep track of the number of pull ups you did per day. This should be done by counting them for each session and save them to the total amount per day. Each day a new counter starts.

## Future Features

- Challanges:
  - Let's say you want to do for 30 days 100 pull ups per day. The app should help you keep track of it
  - Increase the amount of pull ups you do per day over a specified period
- Count pull ups via the accelarometer
